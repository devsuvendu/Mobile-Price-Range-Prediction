finally we made result in cross validation of XGB classifier !!
For training score is 98% and testing score 89%.

For testing dataset,

a.I got low(0) price precision 100% of and recall of 100% and f1-score of 100%.

b.I got medium(1) price precision 100% of and recall of 100% and f1-score of 81%.

c.I got High(2) price precision 100% of and recall of 100% and f1-score of 100%.

d.I got very high(3) price precision 100% of and recall of 100% and f1-score of 100%.
